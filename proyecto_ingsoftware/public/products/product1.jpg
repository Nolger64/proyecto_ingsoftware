The contents of the file /proyecto_ingsoftware/proyecto_ingsoftware/public/products/product1.jpg should be an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, please ensure that you have the appropriate image file named "product1.jpg" in the specified directory. 

If you need to create or modify the image, you can use an image editing tool to create a suitable product image and save it in the specified location.
